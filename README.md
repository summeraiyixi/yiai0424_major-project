Perlin Noise:

Perlin noise is utilized in the Apple class to simulate natural growth of the apples. Specifically, it's used in the update method of the Apple class.
noise is a function that generates Perlin noise, and this.noiseOffset is used to drive the noise over time.


Random Values:

Random values are used extensively throughout the code to determine various properties such as positions, colors, sizes, and growth rates.
Functions like random() and lerp() (linear interpolation with random values) are used for creating randomness in positions and other properties.
